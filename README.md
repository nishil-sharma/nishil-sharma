# Hi!

I'm a first-year undergraduate studying physics with a biophysics concentration @ Case Western Reserve University. I have a broad range of interests, but I'm focusing on computational methods, dynamical systems, and statistical physics at the moment.

I'm also interested in music and old languages.
